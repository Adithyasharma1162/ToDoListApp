# ToDo List Application Architecture

## High-Level System Overview
The ToDoListApp is a web-based application that allows users to create, update, and delete tasks. The application should have a user-friendly interface and must support multiple users to manage their own to-do lists. The system will be designed to handle a growing number of users and tasks efficiently.

## Key Components/Modules
### 1. Frontend:
- **Framework**: React.js for a dynamic client-side interface.
- **State Management**: Redux for managing application state effectively.

### 2. Backend:
- **Framework**: Node.js with Express.js for creating RESTful APIs.
- **Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure user authentication.
- **Service Layer**: Business logic handling for task management.

### 3. Database:
- **Choice**: MongoDB for its flexibility in storing user tasks in a document-oriented format.
- **Schemas**:
  ```
  User Schema:
  {
      username: String,
      password: String,
      email: String,
      tasks: [{ taskId: String, title: String, completed: Boolean }]
  }

  Task Schema:
  {
      userId: String,
      title: String,
      completed: Boolean,
      created_at: Date,
      updated_at: Date
  }
  ```

### 4. Deployment:
- Use Docker for containerization.
- Deploy on cloud platforms like AWS or Heroku for scalability.
- Set up CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.

## Database Schema
- **MongoDB Collections**:
  - **Users**: Stores user information and their associated tasks.
  - **Tasks**: Each task will be linked to a user by their ID.

## Deployment Strategy
1. Containerize the application with Docker.
2. Use Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Heroku for cloud-based hosting.
3. Implement a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using GitHub Actions to automate testing, building, and deployment.

## Tech Stack Recommendations
- **Frontend**: React.js, Redux
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, JWT
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Cloud Hosting**: AWS/Heroku
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions

## Best Practices
- Ensure code quality through code reviews and automated testing.
- Use environment variables for configuration management.
- Implement logging and monitoring for system performance tracking.
